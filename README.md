# Building-Enterprise-Mobile-Application
Pluralsight "Building an Enterprise Mobile Application with Xamarin.Forms" course repository

### Course Info

- Xamarin.Forms is Microsoft's recommended way of building mobile, cross-platform applications. This course will teach you how to build mobile applications for the enterprise with the MVVM pattern, dependency injection, commanding, testing, and more.

- Xamarin.Forms is the preferred way for Microsoft developers to build applications that run on Android, iOS, and Windows. To use Xamarin.Forms for real applications that meet todayâ€™s requirements for flexibility and testability, you need to structure code according to industry-standard architecture guidelines. In this course, Building an Enterprise Mobile Application with Xamarin.Forms, you will learn how a real-life application is built with Xamarin.Forms. First, you will see a proposed architecture that promotes code-reuse as well as testability and maintainability. Next, you will learn how MVVM can be used in Xamarin.Forms. Then, you will create loose-coupling through messaging patterns and dependency injection, which are integrated in the proposed architecture. By the end of this course, you will have a good understanding of a real-life application architecture for Xamarin.Forms applications.

## Assignment Scenario

-  Build an application for Bethany who runs a great little pie shop in Belgium. Bethany bakes the most delicious pies and after having a new website, she also now needs to have a mobile application. Bethany is very tech savvy and she thinks that very soon customers of hers will be placing orders via her mobile application. Create a mobile application for both iOS and Android. In the application, users can browse the catalog, place an order, send feedback, or make a phone call directly from the application. We decided to build this application with Xamarin. Forms. 

## Tasks

- Build Mobile application
- Users can browse catalog
- Users can place orders
- Users can give feedback
- Users can call store from application
- Users must authenticate

## Project Architecture Goals

- Separation of concerns
- Testability
- Maintainability
- Loose coupling
- Code share
